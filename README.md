# **MEMORY GAME WITH VANILLA JS**
## **OVERVIEW**
Simple memory game using ***Vanilla JavaScript*** designed to demonstrate a simple approach to educational game design.

The project uses some techniques different from the usual ones, citing as an example the use of ***yarn*** and ***post-css***.

For project execution, no additional steps will be necessary, as for development we have some dependencies in the project to facilitate the work, such as ***eslint*** and ***prettier***.
